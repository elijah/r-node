Installation Instructions for R-Node

Contact drjlove@gmail.com for help or support (I'll do what I can).

Short and sweet at the moment.

Pre-requisites:

  1. Install R (http://www.r-project.org/)

     Ubuntu and apt-get systems, try:

     sudo apt-get install r-base

  2. Install Rserve (http://www.rforge.net/Rserve/doc.html)

     sudo apt-get install r-cran-rserve
     
     or, others, run R, then type:

     install.packages("Rserve")

  3. Install Node.js. (ensure you 'make install').
     Follow instructions on: http://nodejs.org/

  4. Run RServe. E.g. Run R then type:

     library(Rserve)
     Rserve()
   
     You should see:

     Starting Rserve on port 6311 :

  5. Build R-Node:

     cd r-node
     make

     This should build a 'deploy' directory.
     You'll need gcc installed to build the Node.JS library.

  6. Run R-Node:

     cd deploy
     ./run-server.sh

     You should see similar to this:

11 Apr 22:11:48 - (local): Cannot load configuration from 'etc/config.js'. Trying second option 'etc/config-example.js'
11 Apr 22:11:48 - (local): Loaded configuration from 'etc/config-example.js'

11 Apr 22:11:48 - (local): No Mutt found. Printing feedback to stdout
11 Apr 22:11:48 - (local): RServe requires login. Using information from config.
11 Apr 22:11:48 - (local): R-Node Listening on port: '2903', interface: 'all'
11 Apr 22:11:48 - (local): Logged into R via RServe: true
11 Apr 22:11:48 - (local): Running R setup command 'rNodePager = function (files, header, title, f) { r <- files; attr(r, 'class') <- 'RNodePager'; attr(r, 'header') <- header; attr(r, 'title') <- title; attr(r, 'delete') <- f; r; }'
11 Apr 22:11:48 - (local): Running R setup command 'options(pager=rNodePager)'
DEBUG: Setup command response: {"values":null,"attributes":{"source":["function (files, header, title, f) { r <- files; attr(r, 'class') <- 'RNodePager'; attr(r, 'header') <- header; attr(r, 'title') <- title; attr(r, 'delete') <- f; r; }"]}}
DEBUG: Setup command response: {"data":{"pager":["/usr/lib/R/bin/pager"]},"attributes":{}}

  7. Using Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox etc, connect
     to the UI:

     http://localhost:2903/

  8. If using R 2.10 or greater, and if you want help, you need to start up a R help
     server. I have not been able to figure out how to do this automatically yet, so
     in the meanwhile you must start a separate R instance and run the
     R help server. To do this, run the R commands:

     options(help.ports = c(22900)); 
     tools::startDynamicHelp();

     You can choose any port you like, but 22900 is the default port in the RServe
     configuration.

  9. Try following the sample session listed in Appendix A of:

      cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf

 10. Copy the file server/etc/config-example.js to server/etc/config.js,
     edit and alter the configuration settings to be more appropriate for
     your environment.
